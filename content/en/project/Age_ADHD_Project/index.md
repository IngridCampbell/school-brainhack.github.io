## Project definition

### Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. ADHD is characterized by significant neurophysiological differences that can be observed in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. 
EEG is a neuroimaging technique used to extract features and patterns, such as power spectral bands, where there are five bands that represent different functional characteristics (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma). For example, the theta band is associated with deep sleep and the beta band is associated with awake states and concentration. The theta-beta ratio is a well-known pattern in ADHD along with the alpha peak frequency associated with focus.
A promising development in EEG research is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as an advanced signal processing tool. There are also age-related changes in quantitative EEG in ADHD. However, there is a lack of personalized treatment recommendations based on EEG patterns and age for individuals with ADHD

### Tools

The "project template" project will rely on the following technologies:
 * Python programming for signal processing and statistics: numpy, scipy, FOOOF
 * R for implementing regression and Random Forest algorithms and visualization: caret, randomForest, ggplot2
 * Jupyter notebooks + local laptops for teamwork collaboration, handling data and metadata
 * Github for project management, collaboration and pull requests.
   
### Data

The data used in this project can be downloaded from https://brainclinics.com/resources/tdbrain-dataset/introduction/downloads upon creation of a BrainClinics account. The TDBrain database is an extensive clinical EEG dataset (n=1274) with 19 electrodes collected over two decades from participants ranging age 5 to 89 years old. The database is publicly available and was originally published by Van Dijk 2022 in Scientific Data. The dataset has since been reanalyzed in several publications. At this link, metadata, raw EEG data, and preprocessing pipeline for artifact identification was provided. The raw EEG data was recording from resting state periods (2 minutes of eyes closed followed by 2 minutes of eyes open). The ADHD cohort (n=274) included a sub-cohort with treatment responses of neurofeeback treatment.

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we have:
 - Workflows in Python
 - Workflow in R
 - Individual reports
   
## Results

### Progress overview

The project was created by Ingrid Campbell and Amanda/TianYi Liu during Brainhack school 2025. This is the first version.

### Tools I learned during this project

 * **Clinical EEG preprocessing and signal processing** Using signal processing techniques such as artifact detection and removal, epoching, power band feature extraction (of 2019 features from electrodes Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, Fz, Cz, C3, C4), along with FOOOF, and data cleaning to handle missing data.
 * **Meta data extrapolation** The meta data included demographics (age, gender, education), NEO-FFI personality data, behavioural measures, and treatment responses to ADHD and neurofeedback.
 * **Feature selection** Using bootstrap validation to find the optimal number of features and top features to discriminate between age in participants with ADHD. Using random forest classifier
 * **Age-dependent analysis** age group stratification then pattern visualization. Examining age and EEG correlations as well as random forest classification model performance.
 * **Github collaboration** 

### Results

#### Deliverable 1: report template

You are currently reading the report template! I will let you judge whether it is useful or not. If you think there is something that could be improved, please do not hesitate to open an issue [here](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/project_template/issues) and let us know.

#### Deliverable 2: project gallery

There is not yet a project gallery, as BHS 2020 is the first edition that will incorporate it on the website. You can still check out the [2019 BHS github organization](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019)

##### EEG pupilometry pipeline by Marce Kauffmann

The repository of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/ecg_pupillometry_pipeline_kaufmann). The objective was to create a processing pipeline for ECG and pupillometry data. The motivation behind this task is that Marcel's lab (MIST Lab @ Polytechnique Montreal) was conducting a Human-Robot-Interaction user study. The repo features:
 * a [video introduction](http://www.youtube.com/watch/8ZVCNeX42_A) to the project.
 * a presentation [made in a jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/ecg_pupillometry_pipeline_kaufmann/blob/master/BrainHackPresentation.ipynb) on the results of the project.
 * Notebooks for all analyses.
 * Detailed requirements files, making it easy for others to replicate the environment of the notebook.
 * An overview of the results in the markdown document.

## Conclusion and acknowledgement

The BHS team hope you will find this template helpful in documenting your project. Developping this template was a group effort, and benefitted from the feedback and ideas of all BHS students over the years.
